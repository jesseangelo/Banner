== Banner ==

  An animation sequencer for AS3.


/ Description
  
  Banner was created to make animations easier to create and edit in Flash. It uses AS3 and Flash's built-in Tween class.'


/ Features
  
  * Short-hand notation
  * Link animations
  * Ease of editing timing and fine-tuning

/ How to use

  1. Include the files in your project:
    
    'import com.jesseangelo.Banner.*;'
    
  2. Create instance:
    
    'Scheduler.getInstance();'
    
  3. Queue animations. Scheduler will perform animations one after another, in the order they are entered; the timing is based on the 'when' parameter.
  For example:
  
    Scheduler.fadeIn(foo, 0);
    Scheduler.fadeOut(foo, 100);
    
    Here Scheduler will fade in the movieClip 'foo' at 0 ms (immediately), wait 100 milliseconds, and finally fade 'foo' to alpha 0. 
    
  4. Profit!
    
/ Full Function calls
  
  When, speed, and easing are all optional parameters
  
  Fade the clip in from alpha 0
  Scheduler.fadeIn(clip:MovieClip, when:Number=0, speed:Number=SPEED_NORMAL, easing=undefined)

  Fade the clip out from alpha 1
  Scheduler.fadeOut(clip:MovieClip, when:Number=0, speed:Number=SPEED_NORMAL, easing=undefined)

  Scale the clip from current scale to scaleTo
  Scheduler.scale(clip:MovieClip, scaleTo:Number, when:Number=0, speed:Number=SPEED_NORMAL, easing=undefined)

  Translate the clip to a point location
  Scheduler.move(clip:MovieClip, to:Point, when:Number=0, speed:Number=SPEED_NORMAL, easing=undefined)
