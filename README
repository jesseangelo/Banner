== Banner ==

  An animation sequencer for AS3.


/ Description
  
  Banner was created to make animations easier to create and edit in Flash. It uses AS3 and the built-in Tween class.


/ Features
  
  * Short-hand notation
  * Link animations
  * Ease of editing timing and fine-tuning


/ How to use

  1. Include the files in your project:
    
    'import com.jesseangelo.Banner.*;'
    
  2. Create instance:
    
    'Scheduler.getInstance();'
    
  3. Queue animations. Scheduler will perform animations one after another, in the order they are entered; the timing is based on the 'when' parameter.
  For example:
  
    Scheduler.fadeIn(foo, 0);
    Scheduler.fadeOut(foo, 100);
    
    Here Scheduler will fade in the movieClip 'foo' at 0 ms (immediately), wait 100 milliseconds, and finally fade 'foo' to alpha 0. 
    
  4. Profit!
    
    
/ Full Function calls
  
    Fade the clip in from alpha 0
    Scheduler.fadeIn(clip:MovieClip, when:Number=0, speed:Number=SPEED_NORMAL, easing=undefined)
  
    Fade the clip out from alpha 1
    Scheduler.fadeOut(clip:MovieClip, when:Number=0, speed:Number=SPEED_NORMAL, easing=undefined)
  
    Scale the clip from current scale to scaleTo
    Scheduler.scale(clip:MovieClip, scaleTo:Number, when:Number=0, speed:Number=SPEED_NORMAL, easing=undefined)
  
    Translate the clip to a point location
    Scheduler.move(clip:MovieClip, to:Point, when:Number=0, speed:Number=SPEED_NORMAL, easing=undefined)


/ Parameter descriptions:
  
    clip:MovieClip (required) - A reference to the MovieClip to manipulate.
    
    scaleTo:Number (required for scale) - The new target scale.
    
    to:Point (required for move) - A point on the screen to move to.
    
    when:Number (optional) - The Number of milliseconds to begin after previous scheduled action. Default is 0.
    
    speed:Number (optional) - Number of seconds for the action to complete. Scheduler has a few constant speeds built-in. Default is SPEED_NORMAL.
     SPEED_QUICKEST = 0.2;      SPEED_QUICKER  = 0.4;      SPEED_QUICK		= 0.6;
	   SPEED_SNAPPY		= 0.8;      SPEED_NORMAL	= 1.0;      SPEED_SLOW		= 1.2;
    
    easing:ease (optional) - A reference to a Flash-based easing in fl.transitions.easing. Full reference here:
